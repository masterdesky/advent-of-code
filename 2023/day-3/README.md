### Caveats and Solution
Advent of Parsing 2023, day 3. First thoughts: wtf? Can I regex my way out of this? Or should I just use my physicist linalgebra/image processing/neural networks skills? First, I wanted to go with that, however I realized that without `numpy` it won't be that easy to code golf this problem. So, I went with a regex solution, again...

#### First part solution
Since we're code golfing here, notice that our puzzle input is a rectangular matrix. It actually doesn't really matter, this solution could easily work for a non-rectangular matrix too with the correct zero-padding, but now I won't detail that, because my solution is good enough for this puzzle. And we're code golfing here if I haven't mentioned that already.

#### Second part solution
