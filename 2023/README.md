# Advent of Code 2023
My `1st` year of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

My goal for this year was to use a language I'm confident with and to get all the stars. My language of choice, of course, was `Python 3`. However, to not go easy on myself, I tried to code golf as much as possible and find the shortest possible solution I can think of for all problems. Actually, I never code golfed before and this was a great opportunity to try it out.

#### Note:
Code to generate folders:
```bash
for i in $(seq 1 25); do mkdir "day-$i"; done
```
